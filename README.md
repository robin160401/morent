As a team of three, we've created a dynamic car rental platform that caters to the diverse needs of our users. 
Our project is a web application designed to revolutionize the car rental experience. Users can easily search for available vehicles across Germany, filter results based on their specific needs, and book rentals with just a few clicks. With features like city-to-city rentals and advanced search filters, our platform offers a convenient and flexible solution for travelers and locals alike.
